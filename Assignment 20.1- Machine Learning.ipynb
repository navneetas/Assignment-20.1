Bagging is a method in ensemble for improving unstable estimation or classification schemes.  While boosting method are used sequentially to reduce the bias of the combined model.  Boosting and Bagging both can reduce errors by reducing the variance term."

    "Overfitting happens when we have a small dataset and we try to learn from it, so by using a lot of data, overfitting can be avoided. However, if we have a small database and we are forced to come with a model based on that. In such situation, we can use a technique called Cross Validation. In this method, the dataset splits into two section:testing and training datasets, the testing dataset will only test the model while in training dataset, the datapoints will come up with the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this technique,  a model is usually given a dataset of a known data on which training (training data set) is run and a dataset of unknown data against which the model is tested. The idea of cross validation is to define a dataset to “test” the model in the training phase."
